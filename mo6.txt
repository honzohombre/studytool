15.0- Cells respond to external stimuli for survival; these stimuli can either bind to the cell or enter the cell (T/F)
True.

15.1- What are the three types of Extracellular Messenger Molecule signaling?
Extracellular messenger molecules transmit messages between cells
- Autocrine signaling - Cell surface receptors respond to a messenger
- Paracrine signaling - Messenger travels short distances through the Extracellular space
- Endocrine signaling - Messenger moves through the bloodstream

15.1- In Autocrine signaling, receptors generate an intracellular __________ through the _______ enzyme
Intracellular SECOND MESSENGER through the EFFECTOR enzyme
*The second messenger tells the cell what to do (initiate transcription, apoptosis...)

15.1- Describe the process of signal transduction. What are signaling pathways?
Signaling pathways - Path of proteins that change conformation sequentially in series.
   Change in protein conformation is mediated by phosphorylation

15.1- What are some times of protein receptors?
G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs)
Receptor protein-tyrosine kinases (RTKs)
Ligand gated channels
Steroid hormone receptors
Specific receptors such as B-and T-cell receptors
